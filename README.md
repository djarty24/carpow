# CarPOW!
By: Revati Tambe and Yara Abu Saude

Our carpool scheduling app offers a solution to the challenges associated with coordinating rideshares.

### Inspiration
Carpooling, oftentimes, can be quite a scuffed process. To combat this issue, we created CarPOW! a carpool scheduling website that offers a solution to the challenges associated with coordinating rideshares. Our app provides a centralized location for parents to sign up for pick up/drop off time slots, to ensure the process run smoothly, and no one gets left behind!

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're just really happy that we were able to create a working project in time for our first hackathon! There were a few ups and downs, but with a lot of debugging, we managed to end with a product our team is satisfied with.

### What we learned
Aside from just the technical skills we gained, participating in this hackathon helped improve our soft skills. We learned how to brainstorm a realistic project idea, design and develop our product, and _present_ our project within a short time frame.

### What's next for CarPOW!
In the future, we hope to publish CarPOW on both the App Store and Play Store using React Native instead of React. This way, we'd actually be able to implement our project in our community and (hopefully) see the positive impact it makes!
